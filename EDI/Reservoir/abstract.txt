This dataset includes measurements of sediment properties (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and iron-bound organic carbon) in surficial sediment and sedimenting material from two reservoirs: Falling Creek and Beaverdam Reservoirs, both located in Vinton, VA, USA. To measure surficial sediment properties, sediment cores were collected at the deepest site in each reservoir using a gravity corer, and the top 1 cm was frozen then lyophilized. Sediment cores were collected approximately once per month in both reservoirs throughout the stratified period (Mayâ€“November) in 2019 and 2021, though sampling frequency and duration varied by reservoir and year. Sedimenting material was sampled using sediment traps suspended approximately 1 m above the sediment in both reservoirs. Iron-bound organic carbon was measured using the citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite method, and we used a CN analyzer (Elementar VarioMax, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) to determine the amount of OC per unit mass of sediment.
